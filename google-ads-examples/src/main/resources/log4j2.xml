<!--
The Google Ads API Java Client Library uses the slf4j logging facade, allowing
you to plug in a logging framework of your choice. This configuration file
sets up the logging infrastructure using log4j 2.x logging. If you wish to take advantage
of this file and use log4j 2.x as your framework, you must add a dependency on
org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl. Please see http://www.slf4j.org for more
information about slf4j.
