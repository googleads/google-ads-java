// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND CLASS.
/**
 * Service Description: Service to manage ad group asset set
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (AdGroupAssetSetServiceClient adGroupAssetSetServiceClient =
 *     AdGroupAssetSetServiceClient.create()) {
 *   String customerId = "customerId-1581184615";
 *   List<AdGroupAssetSetOperation> operations = new ArrayList<>();
 *   MutateAdGroupAssetSetsResponse response =
 *       adGroupAssetSetServiceClient.mutateAdGroupAssetSets(customerId, operations);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the AdGroupAssetSetServiceClient object to clean up
 * resources such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically
 * calls close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li>A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li>A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of AdGroupAssetSetServiceSettings
 * to create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * AdGroupAssetSetServiceSettings adGroupAssetSetServiceSettings =
 *     AdGroupAssetSetServiceSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * AdGroupAssetSetServiceClient adGroupAssetSetServiceClient =
 *     AdGroupAssetSetServiceClient.create(adGroupAssetSetServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * AdGroupAssetSetServiceSettings adGroupAssetSetServiceSettings =
 *     AdGroupAssetSetServiceSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * AdGroupAssetSetServiceClient adGroupAssetSetServiceClient =
 *     AdGroupAssetSetServiceClient.create(adGroupAssetSetServiceSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
