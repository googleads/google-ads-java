# The Google Ads API Java Client Library uses the slf4j logging facade, allowing
# you to plug in a logging framework of your choice. This configuration file
# sets up the logging infrastructure using JDK logging. If you wish to take advantage
# of this file and use JDK as your framework, you must add a dependency on org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14.
# Please see http://www.slf4j.org for more information about slf4j.
