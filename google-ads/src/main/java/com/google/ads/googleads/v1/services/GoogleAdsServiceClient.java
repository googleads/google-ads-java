// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND SERVICE
/**
 * Service Description: Service to fetch data and metrics across resources.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (GoogleAdsServiceClient googleAdsServiceClient = GoogleAdsServiceClient.create()) {
 *   String customerId = "";
 *   List&lt;MutateOperation&gt; mutateOperations = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
 *   boolean partialFailure = false;
 *   boolean validateOnly = false;
 *   MutateGoogleAdsResponse response = googleAdsServiceClient.mutate(customerId, mutateOperations, partialFailure, validateOnly);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the googleAdsServiceClient object to clean up resources
 * such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls
 * close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li> A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li> A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li> A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of GoogleAdsServiceSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * GoogleAdsServiceSettings googleAdsServiceSettings =
 *     GoogleAdsServiceSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * GoogleAdsServiceClient googleAdsServiceClient =
 *     GoogleAdsServiceClient.create(googleAdsServiceSettings);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * GoogleAdsServiceSettings googleAdsServiceSettings =
 *     GoogleAdsServiceSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * GoogleAdsServiceClient googleAdsServiceClient =
 *     GoogleAdsServiceClient.create(googleAdsServiceSettings);
 * </code>
 * </pre>

  /**
   * Creates, updates, or removes resources. This method supports atomic transactions with multiple
   * types of resources. For example, you can atomically create a campaign and a campaign budget, or
   * perform up to thousands of mutates atomically.
   *
   * <p>This method is essentially a wrapper around a series of mutate methods. The only features it
   * offers over calling those methods directly are: - Atomic transactions - Temp resource names
   * (described below) - Somewhat reduced latency over making a series of mutate calls.
   *
   * <p>Note: Only resources that support atomic transactions are included, so this method can't
   * replace all calls to individual services.
   *
   * <p>## Atomic Transaction Benefits
   *
   * <p>Atomicity makes error handling much easier. If you're making a series of changes and one
   * fails, it can leave your account in an inconsistent state. With atomicity, you either reach the
   * desired state directly, or the request fails and you can retry.
   *
   * <p>## Temp Resource Names
   *
   * <p>Temp resource names are a special type of resource name used to create a resource and
   * reference that resource in the same request. For example, if a campaign budget is created with
   * 'resource_name' equal to 'customers/123/campaignBudgets/-1', that resource name can be reused
   * in the 'Campaign.budget' field in the same request. That way, the two resources are created and
   * linked atomically.
   *
   * <p>To create a temp resource name, put a negative number in the part of the name that the
   * server would normally allocate.
   *
   * <p>Note: - Resources must be created with a temp name before the name can be reused. For
   * example, the previous CampaignBudget+Campaign example would fail if the mutate order was
   * reversed. - Temp names are not remembered across requests. - There's no limit to the number of
   * temp names in a request. - Each temp name must use a unique negative number, even if the
   * resource types differ.
   *
   * <p>## Latency
   *
   * <p>It's important to group mutates by resource type or the request may time out and fail.
   * Latency is roughly equal to a series of calls to individual mutate methods, where each change
   * in resource type is a new call. For example, mutating 10 campaigns then 10 ad groups is like 2
   * calls, while mutating 1 campaign, 1 ad group, 1 campaign, 1 ad group is like 4 calls.
   *
   * <p>Sample code:
   *
   * <pre><code>
   * try (GoogleAdsServiceClient googleAdsServiceClient = GoogleAdsServiceClient.create()) {
   *   String customerId = "";
   *   List&lt;MutateOperation&gt; mutateOperations = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
   *   boolean partialFailure = false;
   *   boolean validateOnly = false;
   *   MutateGoogleAdsResponse response = googleAdsServiceClient.mutate(customerId, mutateOperations, partialFailure, validateOnly);
   * }
   * </code></pre>
   *
   * @param customerId The ID of the customer whose resources are being modified.
   * @param mutateOperations The list of operations to perform on individual resources.
   * @param partialFailure If true, successful operations will be carried out and invalid operations
   *     will return errors. If false, all operations will be carried out in one transaction if and
   *     only if they are all valid. Default is false.
   * @param validateOnly If true, the request is validated but not executed. Only errors are
   *     returned, not results.
   * @throws com.google.api.gax.rpc.ApiException if the remote call fails
